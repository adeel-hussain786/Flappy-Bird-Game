# Flappy Bird Game 🐦🎮

### An Interactive Java Game Project for Data Structures and Algorithms

---

## 📖 Overview
Flappy Bird is a classic arcade game where players guide a bird through gaps in pipes by tapping the screen. The goal? Fly as far as possible without crashing into pipes or hitting the ground. With each successful pass, the player earns points, aiming to beat their high score. This project showcases essential game development concepts, implemented using Java GUI.

## 🛠 Features
- **Addictive Gameplay**: Fun and engaging mechanics requiring skill and timing.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built using Java Swing or JavaFX for smooth user experience.
- **Scoring Mechanism**: Tracks points for every pipe cleared.
- **Randomized Challenges**: Unique pipe arrangements generated dynamically.
- **Collision Detection**: Ensures realistic interactions between the bird and obstacles.
- **Sound Effects**: Adds an immersive feel to the gameplay.
- **High Score Tracking**: Pushes players to beat their best.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Fly Through Pipes**: Navigate the bird through the gaps.
2. **Score Points**: Earn points by clearing obstacles.
3. **Avoid Crashes**: Stay clear of pipes and the ground.
4. **Tap to Flap**: Control the bird’s flight using precise taps.
5. **Beat the High Score**: Push your limits with every game!
